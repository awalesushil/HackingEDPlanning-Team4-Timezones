## Ghost Teacher Detection

**Algorithm**

Our algorithm is based on the Jaroâ€“Winkler similarity measure to check for spelling errors. Three things are accounted for:

1) Matches - the ith letter in the EMIS name matches the ith letter in the Payroll name.
2) Transposition - The ith letter's location is at least close to its correct location
3) Weight - Matches in the first few letters of the names are given more weight than matches near the end of the name
